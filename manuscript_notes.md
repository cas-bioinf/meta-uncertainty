# Evaluating MDS overall

Dunthorn 17: We see that the two clusters for Panama are probably not real

Confidence ellipses (as used in QIIME) likely misleading as the model-based resamples (or even rarefied samples) are nowhere resembling an ellipse.



See threshold where the orginal breaks

Subsample whole samples (and use procrustes only on the overlap)

Plots area

Use Enterotype example data from phyloseq
