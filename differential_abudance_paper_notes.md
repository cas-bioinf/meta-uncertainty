# Ideas


# Introduction

- No (check) way to choose differential abundance library


# Resampling models

- DESeq2
  - Requires groups
- DESeq2 - ungrouped
  - TODO
- ANCOM
  - Probably only posssible to sample on the unobserved scale
  - probably just ANOVA on the log ratios

- Use TweeDESeq for resampling
